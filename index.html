	JPY CSA in USD

	<p>
	Typically JPY OIS -100bps = USD FedFund
	Therefore USDFedFund + 100bps is equivalent discount

	And since when it is asset to you the counterparty post collateral
	This is where you effectively get less money..

	<h2>Presevation of Capital, the latest approach</h2>
	
	
	<h3>Prologue</h3>	  
		  
		  
	<p>
	Yes, this section is titled as <i>preserving capital</i> as, please be honest, that is the bare minimum anyone investing in cash would really have hoped to achieve.</p>

	<p>
	First, should <b>you</b> be managing the presevation of capital? Or should it be outsourced to an mindless ETF? Well it really talk about having (or growing) an edge and an honest opinion balancing your confidence, your preserverence, your hardwork and dedication, your will power, and your available resources (say money, time). Please, do not think that doing n times readings will get you somewhere. That would not. In fact doing 0 reading and n times thinking would probably be a better strategy. Like Jing Gor (王晶) said you have 'success' and 'failure', analyse the reason or driver as to why that happen? What is it that people like, or what is it that really works? (And please do not say luck!)</p>
	
	<h3>Checklist</h3>
	
	<p>
	Every choice made to put on a trade or countering a trade should go through a checklist. Important decisions made in our world, say a set of procedures followed by government or corporate staff, are, quite honestly, to lower the probability of failure (not very upside), but this should not mean in the job of preserving capital this has to deviviate much. Have a checklist ready. And do you know the important items to know? Any business in simple world would require to know a thing or two about the market. Surely people working in Apple and people working in 先達 trading Apple would see things very differently. The pricing strategy involves a smart understanding of all folds (e.g. the landscape of manufacturers in emerging markets, the materials (e.g. silicon) market, the US policy etc), whilst the second-hand iphone trader probably look more closely at supply/demand of direct retail consumers, and timeline. Nevertheless if iphone is what you trade, the 'second-tier' trader mindset is the entry ticket. Not having that means you are prone to losses. So learn about the market, come up with checklist, and treat trading like you are working (not like your casual Counter-Strike day-to-day, but if you were to play CS like a job or with <b>professionalism</b> what would it looks like?</p>
		
	<h3>Emotion</h3>
	
	Emotion is a crazy thing and I do not mean the cliche interpretation of emotion in the sense that you make <b>irrational decision</b> or that 'emotion can make you put on stupid trade'. What I am talking about especially in 2022 when one face huge losses and that can only hit your own emotional health as your hard earn cash get wiped out. The pre-trading plan should do enough work to ensure this does not happen because you are not just losing monetary capital, but also the capital of wellbeing which to me - quality of time, health, family and self are worth much more (or not even comparable) to wealth, especially when you are not (yet) at a point where this is needed.</p>

	<h3>Reading list</h3>
	
	<p>
	Now I have been seeing that ECB, NBER, BIS, Treasury, Fed, and to an extent, HKMA, have good papers trying to learn of the bond market. These are book smart and knowledge article that is in a sense worth reading. Next people like Duffie would spent years understanding the Treasuries are not to be taken lightly. Of course when people said Buffet is investing in Japan, Druckenmiller is shorting Treasuries. Have a good think as to why. You 'do not know' if those ideas are right but you 'know' when an intern come up with you with some ideas or questions related to these big ideas.</p>
	
	<h3>Points</h3>
	<p>
	Think of yourself as a government economist doing a press-conference in 2 hours time, or a meeting with sales or RM who is going to ask what's your view on the bond market - what are the things you would prepare. Maybe you want to learn more about <b>credit creation</b> but it is always a luxury, and people love to talk about supply and demand - market quickly reposition as supply and demand shifts. Market is no difference from a normal person's life: a single day is non materially different from the previous, but over time certain things build up (e.g. having McDonalds hashbrown is ok for a day, but overtime it becomes the root cause of obesity). A overheating CPI figure will certainly means rate hike is to go up- (A) 'slow to react' person would easily come to conclusion that there is a hawkish tilt, which erodes attractiveness of holding US treasuries (as funding in USD goes up), the hawkish tilt may mean more reasonable to buy Treasuries at a later time. (B) the market expect people to chuck some Treasuries out first, people are less biddish, people who are at the bench are going to wait out, and people who are selling may increase their bet. All these are the market expectations of what everyone else who are looking at the market will do. Which means this will be a 'dominant' activities and hence market is going to move a certain way. What is harder is 'what is the level that make sense', you have seen where it whipsawed and stablelise in day one, then in the next day it goes into one of the directions (can be bull or bear) and create a big candle. There is hence no real answer.
